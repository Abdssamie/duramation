# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current credentials handling system is fragmented across frontend and backend with inconsistent types, duplicate interfaces, and complex maintenance overhead. This feature consolidates all credential-related types, interfaces, and utilities into the shared package (`packages/shared`) to create a single source of truth for credential management across the entire application. The goal is to simplify credential handling, reduce code duplication, and make the system easier to maintain and extend.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the codebase, I want all credential types and interfaces centralized in the shared package, so that I have a single source of truth for credential-related data structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need credential types THEN the system SHALL provide all types from `packages/shared/src/types/credentials.ts`
2. WHEN I import credential types THEN the system SHALL export consistent interfaces across frontend and backend
3. WHEN credential types are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically propagate changes to all consuming applications
4. WHEN new credential providers are added THEN the system SHALL require only updates to the shared package

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer implementing credential functionality, I want standardized credential utilities and helpers, so that I can perform common credential operations consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need credential validation THEN the system SHALL provide validation utilities from the shared package
2. WHEN I need credential status calculation THEN the system SHALL provide status utilities that work with standardized types
3. WHEN I need provider information THEN the system SHALL provide provider utilities with consistent data structures
4. WHEN I perform credential operations THEN the system SHALL use shared utility functions for consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the credential system, I want simplified credential management patterns, so that adding new providers and credential types requires minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a new credential provider THEN the system SHALL require only configuration updates in the shared package
2. WHEN I extend credential functionality THEN the system SHALL use extensible patterns that don't require changes across multiple files
3. WHEN I modify credential schemas THEN the system SHALL automatically update validation and type checking
4. WHEN I implement credential features THEN the system SHALL provide clear patterns and abstractions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with workflows and credentials, I want unified workflow-credential integration types, so that the relationship between workflows and credentials is consistent and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with workflow credentials THEN the system SHALL provide unified types for workflow-credential relationships
2. WHEN I check credential requirements THEN the system SHALL use standardized requirement checking logic
3. WHEN I associate credentials with workflows THEN the system SHALL use consistent association patterns
4. WHEN I validate workflow credentials THEN the system SHALL use shared validation logic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing authentication flows, I want standardized authentication and OAuth patterns, so that adding new OAuth providers follows consistent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I implement OAuth flows THEN the system SHALL provide standardized OAuth configuration types
2. WHEN I handle authentication responses THEN the system SHALL use consistent response parsing utilities
3. WHEN I manage OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL use shared token management utilities
4. WHEN I add new OAuth providers THEN the system SHALL follow established configuration patterns
