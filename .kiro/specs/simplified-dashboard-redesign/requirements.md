# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature redesigns the existing dashboard overview to focus on essential KPIs and metrics that provide immediate business value. The current dashboard has become overly complex and exceeds MVP scope. This simplified version will display core workflow metrics, automation statistics, and a single meaningful chart showing workflow activity over time, while maintaining the existing layout structure in `/dashboard/overview`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to see essential workflow KPIs at a glance, so that I can quickly understand my automation performance and business impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the dashboard overview THEN the system SHALL display workflow runs this month with trend indicator
2. WHEN I view the KPI cards THEN the system SHALL show total automations executed count
3. WHEN I check execution metrics THEN the system SHALL display average execution time
4. WHEN I review business impact THEN the system SHALL show estimated time or money saved
5. WHEN I assess workflow health THEN the system SHALL display workflow success rate and failure rate
6. WHEN I view workflow status THEN the system SHALL show active vs inactive workflows with their types (scheduled/cron vs direct execution)
7. WHEN I check sales metrics THEN the system SHALL display sales calls scheduled and completed counts
8. WHEN I review growth metrics THEN the system SHALL show new workflows added this month

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to see workflow activity trends over time, so that I can understand usage patterns and growth in automation adoption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a "Workflow Runs Over Time" chart
2. WHEN I interact with the chart THEN the system SHALL show data as a line chart or area chart
3. WHEN I examine the chart axes THEN the system SHALL display dates on X-axis and number of workflow runs on Y-axis
4. WHEN I want different time perspectives THEN the system SHALL provide filter options for 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days
5. WHEN I need specific insights THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by specific workflow
6. WHEN I analyze trends THEN the system SHALL overlay a trendline or moving average
7. WHEN I review the chart THEN the system SHALL help me understand how automation usage grows over time

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the existing layout structure, so that the redesign integrates seamlessly with the current dashboard architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the redesign THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing layout in `/dashboard/overview`
2. WHEN updating components THEN the system SHALL maintain the current parallel route structure with slots
3. WHEN displaying KPI cards THEN the system SHALL use the existing card grid layout (4 columns on large screens)
4. WHEN showing charts THEN the system SHALL utilize the existing 2-column grid for chart sections
5. WHEN rendering the page THEN the system SHALL keep the current PageContainer wrapper structure
6. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL maintain existing CSS classes and design system consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the dashboard to load quickly and display accurate real-time data, so that I can make informed decisions based on current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL load all KPI data within 2 seconds
2. WHEN metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL show data that is no more than 5 minutes old
3. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the system SHALL display data efficiently without performance degradation
4. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest metrics from the backend API
5. WHEN data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states or error messages
6. WHEN calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy in trend calculations and percentage displays
