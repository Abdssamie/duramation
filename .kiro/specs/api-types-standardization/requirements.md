# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature standardizes all API endpoint request/response types and interfaces by moving them to the shared package. This will improve type safety, reduce code duplication, and provide consistent error handling across all endpoints in the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API types and interfaces centralized in the shared package, so that I can maintain consistency across frontend and backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create API request/response types THEN they SHALL be defined in the shared package
2. WHEN I use API types THEN they SHALL be imported from @duramation/shared
3. WHEN I add new endpoints THEN they SHALL use standardized types from shared package

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized error response types, so that error handling is consistent across all endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API error occurs THEN it SHALL return a standardized error response format
2. WHEN validation fails THEN it SHALL return structured validation error details
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN it SHALL return consistent auth error responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want common request/response patterns defined as reusable types, so that I can quickly implement new endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need pagination THEN I SHALL use standardized pagination types
2. WHEN I need success responses THEN I SHALL use standardized success response types
3. WHEN I need query parameters THEN I SHALL use standardized query parameter types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing endpoints updated to use the new standardized types, so that the entire API is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review any endpoint THEN it SHALL use types from the shared package
2. WHEN I make API calls from frontend THEN they SHALL use the same types as backend
3. WHEN I add validation THEN it SHALL use shared validation schemas
